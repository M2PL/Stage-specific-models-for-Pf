The StardropDesc.csv file contains the SMILES and their predicted StarDrop physiochemical properties such as:
logS, logD, logP, molecular weight, TPSA, molecular flexability, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors as well as rotatable bonds. 
Additionally, the stage-specific activity of the compounds are summarised in the class column. This data would be utilised
for multi-class model building.


The OriginalData.csv file contains SMILES of compounds, their trivial name, compound identifier and experimental information of the
compound's activity towards specific parasite stages. Note: some compounds have not been evaluated on certain parasite stages and hence
no value is attributed and left as blank.
