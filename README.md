# Stage-specific prediction model for _Plasmodium falciparum_
This code corresponds to the work done by M2PL in building stage-specific activity prediction models in classifying compounds compounds into
four groups, namely:

**(1)** asexual blood stage (ABS) activity

**(2)** ABS and immature gametocyte activity (ABS & iGc)

**(3)** ABS and late gametocyte activity (ABS & LGc)

**(4)** ABS and mature gametocyte activity (ABS & mGc). 

Code relating to model building and evaluation are contained within the respective folder
and the datasets for scripts are available in the datasets folder.
